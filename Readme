/*
 *  This program uses the equations and algorithms found in
 *  "Mean square flux noise in SQUIDs and qubits: numerical
 *  calculations" by S M Anton, I A B Sognnaes,
 *  J S Birenbaum, S R Oâ€™Kelley,C J Fourie and John Clarke.
 *  to determine the magnetic field intensity at given points
 *  induced by a current density matix recieved by InducEx.
 *  The program was first made in Matlab by Steven M Anton and then
 *  re-written into C by Eaton Meyer Emmerich.
 *
 *  This program is used through a command terminal with the
 *  following parameters:
 *  % (current density filename) ([-p] [-m] [-h]) (arg1 arg2 arg3 ...)
